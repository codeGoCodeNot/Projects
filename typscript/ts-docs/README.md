# Typescript Knowledge Vault

Hey, I’m Johnsen Berdin documenting my journey to level up my skills every day.

This project is a personal knowledge vault built in React and TypeScript. Here you’ll find an organized collection of code notes and examples, covering everything from frontend to backend. The interface lets you explore categories ("Basic", "Intermediate", "Advanced") and read short docs with code snippets for each topic.

## Features

- **Browse Categories** – Filter tech notes by category (basic, intermediate, advanced).
- **Read Code Notes** – Each note includes a title, explanation, and example TypeScript code.
- **About Me Panel** – Learn more about the developer and the philosophy behind the project.
- **Social & Contact Links** – Find my LinkedIn, GitHub, email, and phone in the footer.

## How to Use

1. Start the app with `npm start` (or your preferred React command).
2. Click on “About Me” to see info about the project and author.
3. Select a category to explore related notes and examples.
4. Connect with me using the contact links at the bottom!
